        <h2>About</h2>
    

                    

<p>
    The Microsimulation &amp; Risk Modelling group at the University of Wollongong is developing novel techniques and tools for
    analysing risks affecting society and the adequacy of their control, both speculatively and post-mortem.
</p>

<p>
    The project began in 2007 with the aim of investigating discrete computer
    simulation of disease epidemics in contrast to the traditional methods of
    statistical analysis as well as other high consequence threats to society.
</p>

<p>
	As of 2014, it comprises a number of research efforts.
</p>

<h3>Software Research and Development</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><a href="soft-simulacron.html">Simulacron</a></dt>
    <dd>
        Simulacron is our microsimulation framework; it abstracts away the
        common functionality used in our simulations to allow for more efficient
        construction of new models.  Rather than a fixed set of capabilities,
        simulation functionality is implemented in modules.
        A number of related tools also fall under the umbrella of this
        project.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="sim.html">Simulation Modules</a></dt>
    <dd>
        A number of simulation modules have been developed that give simulations functionality such as people movement,
         infection spread and the spread of influence between people.
    </dd>

    <dt><!--<a href="soft-jazz.html">--><strong>Jazz Visualisation Framework</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        Jazz is our visualisation package.  Presently at the prototype stage,
        it will be a flexible, extensible framework for building data
        visualisation and processing tools.
    </dd>

            <div class="name">Dr. Anthony Green</div>
            <div class="profile">
        <p>
            Dr. Anthony (Tony) Green has over 35 years experience as a specialist in catastrophic risk
             associated with Fire, Explosion and Terrorism alongside all natural and civil disasters and industrial failure events.  
             His working career commenced in the United Kingdom in the HSE Buxton Explosion facility following a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Edinburgh.  
             A decision to move to a wider applied science field led to an appointment to the forerunner of the WorkCover Authority of NSW, Australia and from this point his
             research and practice became holistic and grounded in industry: a challenging breath of research, policy and investigation work into catastrophic risks associated with 
             industry and government. Tony together with Ian Piper has been the driving force in the developement and demonstration of the use of microsimulation for the study
             of catastrophic risks to society.

        <p>
            Dr. Ian Piper has been involved in research in the area of simulation for over 35 years with initial interests in mine ventilation and underground explosions. He has worked at the University of Wollongong for most of this period, with a four-year break in which he was R&amp;D manager and director of FreeNet Corp. His other research areas include visualisation and the Specification of large software systems.

        <p><em>Senior Research Associate, <a href="http://www.terrorism.org/">Terrorism Research Center (Washington DC)</a>.</em></p>
        <p>Christopher Flaherty has a Ph.D. in Economic Relations from the University of Melbourne with a focus on networking. 
        Following this, he pursued a career in defence and security research in the Australian Department of Defence. 
        Christopher has been based in London since 2008. A Senior Research Associate of the Terrorism Research Center (TRC), 
        he regularly contributes to its' current publications. He is also the co-primary author of Body Cavity Bombers: The New Martyrs (iUniverse, 2013). 
        Two essays of his from 2003 and 2010 were reprinted in the TRC book - Fifth Dimensional Operations (iUniverse, 2014). 
        He is the author of Australian Manoeuvrist Strategy (Seaview Press, 1996). Christopher has been an active contributor on security, 
        terrorism early warning, and related international intelligence issues, including tactics, techniques and procedures analysis, 
        published in the TRC report 'Dangerous Minds' (2012). He has a long-term involvement in the microsimulation and risk modelling group.
