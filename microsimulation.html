        <h2>What is Microsimulation?</h2>
    

                    

<p>Microsimulation is a discrete modelling technique that allows the study of populations based on the behaviour of each indivdual in the model rather than based on aggregated data. An individual's properties are sampled from data distributions for the property or from picking a probability. For example, in infection studies, transmission of disease from one person to another is a simple probability while the period of incubation is chosen from a lognormal or similar distribution.</p>

<h2>Why Microsimulation?</h2>

<p>Each individual behaviour can be altered by internal and external influences. 
This is not something that can be achieved with aggregated data on behaviours and 
is a more realistic aproach for studying threat in society.</p>

<h2>How is this done?</h2>

<p>We have developed a microsimulation framework, simulacron, and analysis tools for display:</p>

    <dt><a href="soft-simulacron.html">Simulacron</a></dt>
    <dd>
        <p>Simulacron is our microsimulation framework; it abstracts away the common functionality used in our simulations to allow for more efficient construction of new models.  Rather than a fixed set of capabilities, simulation functionality is implemented in modules.  A number of related tools also fall under the umbrella of this project.</p>

        <p>Associated toools include Refinery, Monotony and Spiderweb, which are infection analysis engines that allow matching to historical data and display of infection chains.</p>

    <dd>
        <p>A number of modules have been constructed to increase the functionality of Simulacron:</p>

        <p>Jazz is our visualisation package.  Presently at the prototype stage, it will be a flexible, extensible framework for building data visualisation and processing tools.</p>

    <dd>
    This was our first case study and focused on reproducing an
    historical influenza epidemic using our simulation techniques.  It
    demonstrated that microsimulation could provide realistic results that
    agreed with historical data.

    Typical Australian Community</a></dt>
    <dd>
    Our second case study was directed toward speculatively modelling the
    detonation of a smallpox bomb in a statistically average Australian
    community.  The community profile itself is derived from
    <abbr title="Australian Bureau of Statistics">ABS</abbr>
    data.

    <dd>
    This case study involved the SARS outbreak at Amoy Gardens in Hong
    Kong.  This problem was chosen to study the effect of forced isolation
    and to demonstrate a two vector problem could be solved using our
    techniques.

    Station</a></dt>
    <dd>
    The Sydney Central Station is being used as an
    initial test bed for assessing terrorist threat and emergency
    response in an extended infrastructure that has a regular but
    variable daily transient population of commuters and tourists. This
    is an example of a complex space with overlying threats and the
    research is aimed at developing both normal and emergency response
    behaviours to different types of terrorist threats.
