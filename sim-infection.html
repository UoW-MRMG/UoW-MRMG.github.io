<p>Our infection module was the first major simulation component to be
completed.  It allows us to simulate the spread and progress of a single
infectious agent through the population.</p>

<p>It was initially used to model the spread of influenza as part of our
<!--<a href="studies-rns.html">-->Royal Naval School influenza case study.  It works through the use of a relatively simple, though novel, infection model called SLASHR.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="img/infection.png" width="633"/></p>

<p>The module simulates infection spread via close physical contact and tracks
the progress of the infection from initial infection to either recovery or
death.  It also incorporates time-dependent isolation and the related concept
of "hero time".</p>

<p>Isolation simulates the segregation of symptomatic individuals from the
remainder of the population.  Time-dependence is used to ensure that peeps are
not isolated at nonsensical times.  In the case of the RNS, consider that a
student becoming symptomatic during the night is unlikely to be
instantaneously isolated; it is more likely that their symptoms will only be
noticed and acted upon in the morning.</p>

<p>Related to this is "hero time"; this approximates the common behaviour of
people whereby they will ignore or even conceal symptoms of sickness due to
perceived unimportance.  This concealment is factored into a peep's chance of
being isolated at any given moment; at the beginning of hero time, a peep has
a zero percent chance of being "detected".  This increases linearly to the end
of hero time, at which point the peep has a 100% chance to be detected.</p>

<p>The infection module also provides functionality to control the spread of
infections based on masking.  This allows the population to be divided into
different groups which may only infect a specific set of groups.  This can be
used to implement diseases such as Schistosomiasis.</p>
