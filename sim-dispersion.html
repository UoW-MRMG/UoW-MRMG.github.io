        <h2>Dispersion</h2>
    

                    

<p>The dispersion module was developed to satisfy a need for chaotic behaviour
in peeps.  In our <a href="studies-rns.html">RNS case study</a>, one aspect of
the model was of children playing in a courtyard.  Such behaviour is difficult
to model directly.</p>

<p class="float-right"><img src="img/peep-movement.png" width="50%"/></p>

<p>Instead, the dispersion module was developed which allowed the environment
itself to direct the children peeps to move about in a pseudo-random
fashion.</p>

<p>Any given cell can be given a list of dispersion targets.  At each
simulated tick, every peep within the origin cell is relocated to a random
target cell.  In the case of RNS the courtyard was divided into four
quadrants, each of which dispersed into the others.</p>

<p>The dispersion module was later expanded with the capability to
discriminate between peeps based on masking; peeps could have their
destination selected from a specific set of cells based on an attached
mask.</p>

<p>To date, the dispersion module has been employed in simulating children
playing (as already noted), movement of workers within a high-rise office
building, progress through a train station and even the path of airborne
contagions.</p>
